# Abstract

DeepProbLog is a Neuro-Symbolic (Ne-Sy) paradigm that incorporates deep learning into an existing proba- bilistic logic programming language, ProbLog, through neural predicates. DeepProbLog has been tested on var- ious complex problems that involve learning and rea- soning such as MNIST addition, sorting, word algebra problems, etc. In solving these problems, DeepProbLog achieved state-of-the-art results. However, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no implementation of DeepProbLog for solving Sudoku. So, for this project, I will be testing DeepProbLog on Sudoku. I aim to analyze the performance of learning and inference by DeepProbLog for two tasks: classifying visual Sudoku, and solving visual Sudoku. My goal is to gain deeper in- sights into the integration of neural nets with ProbLog, and compare DeepProbLog with various Ne-Sy frameworks.

# Spoiler

I could not finish the project. I added all the code I could find from the time I worked on this project.
